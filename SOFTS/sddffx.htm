<p>The program, <em>sddffx</em>, takes a <em>gmerge</em> file, a precise orbit in
SP3 format, and computes the position for 
point 2 using single frequency (L1), double difference carrier phase.
The carrier phase ambiguities are solved in an "ambiguity float" step, 
and then fixed to integer or half-integer values in an "ambiguity fix" step.

<p>Operation</a></h4>

<p>The program operates in the DOS window.  It will issue a prompt:
<pre>
Half wavelength?:
</pre>
If your data have half-wavelength phase ambiguities (as typical for non-geodetic
GPS receivers) then respond with the letter <em>y</em> or <em>Y</em>.
If both receivers are full-wavelength, then type  <em>n</em> or <em>N</em>.

<p>Two files are needed for input.  Two files are generated as output.  
The names are fixed.  The files must be in the subdirectory where you are
working.

<p>Input Files:

<p><em>gmerge.out</em> -- ASCII, "gmerge" format.  This is merged pseudorange
and carrier phase, at a common interval and data rate.  The first station (point1)
and the second station (point 2) are assumed fixed (static solution).
Follow the link for information on making a <a href="gmerge.htm">gmerge file</a>.

<p><em>orbit.sp3</em> -- ASCII, SP3 format, precise orbit.

<p>Output Files:

<p><em>sddffx.lst</em> -- ASCII, listing.  Just a log file confirming processing.

<p><em>sddffx.out</em> -- ASCII, residual listing.  These are the residuals, in the
sense of observed-computed, for every double difference satellite pair, every epoch.

<p>Discussion:

<p>The double difference carrier phase is a "Holy Grail" solution.
This is because carrier phase is about 100 times more precise than
pseudorange.
The double difference cancels clock error in the GPS satellites (tiny) and
in the GPS receivers (not tiny).  What's left is orbit error, atmospheric
error, and local (multipath and noise).
What's also left is the double difference carrier phase ambiguity.  If (and
this is a big <em>if</em>) one can resolve the ambiguities, then you get
a solution good to a few centimeters.

<p><em>sddffx</em> uses a <em>very</em> elementary algorithm to compute
the solution.  
The carrier phase ambiguities are solved in an "ambiguity float" step, 
and then fixed to integer or half-integer values in an "ambiguity fix" step.
Then, the ambiguity fix solution is recomputed using the the point 2 coordinate
values in the prior step.  All three steps iterate to eliminate outliers.
The solutions do not consider double difference correlations (hence, no

LAMBDA ambiguity resolution

), nor ionosphere error.

<p><em>sddffx</em> is guaranteed to <em>fail</em> if too little data are
supplied, if the data have too many dropouts (e.g. under foliage), if the
GPS receiver baseline is too long, or if there is strong multipath.  These
restrictions are stronger if one is is using a half-wavelength ambiguity
GPS receiver.  And, there are trade-offs among these factors.  I have solved
baselines of 1 km with a couple of hours of half-wavelength phase data.
I'm sure the solutions will fail at 10 km no matter how much data are used.

<p><em>gmerge</em> Format</a></h4>

<p>This is a simple ASCII, flat file.  The header contains exactly 14 records.
The 14-th record indicates how many epoch sets follow.

<p>Each epoch set consists of an epoch header and a number of data records.
There is one data record for each satellite in the epoch.

<p>Here is the detailed <a href="gmerge.fmt.txt">gmerge format</a> file.
Follow the link for more information on making a <a href="gmerge.htm">gmerge file</a>.

<p>Here is a sample <a href="gmerge.out.txt">gmerge.out</a> file.  It was
generated between two CORS stations, SEAT to SEAW, for 3 epochs of
data.  Note the null values (99999999.999) generated whenever a given data 
element is not available.  Time is in seconds from midnight (GPS time) of
the day in the first record of the file (20jan2002).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h4><a name="link2"><hr>
<p>SP3 Format</a></h4>

<p>Precise orbits are distributed in a format called SP3.
The format is available from
<a href="http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/GPS/SP3_format.html">NGS</a> and 
<a href="sp3fmt.txt">here</a>.  If you need the orbits themselves, they are
easy to get from NGS at their 
<a href="http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/CORS/">CORS</a> site. 

<p>Here is a sample <a href="igs10711.sp3.txt">igs10711.sp3</a> (316K) SP3 orbit.
It is a precise orbit solution computed by the International GPS Service (IGS).
(It was also concatenated with the next day's orbit.)
Note that if there is an entry of "999999.999999" in the clock field, then that 
satellite can't be used for that epoch.

<p>Residual File</a></h4>

<p><em>sddffx.res</em> is a simple ASCII, flat file.  One record per double
difference residual.

<pre>
01-09  time, seconds past midnight, GPS time
10-18  double difference carrier phase residual error, meters, (observed-computed)
19-24  vertical angle, decimal degrees, positive up
25-27  PRN of non-pivot satellite of the double difference.
</pre>

<p>Here is a sample <a href="sddffx.res.txt"><em>sddffx.res</em></a>.  It was
extracted from the beginning of a 24-hour solution from the CORS stations
OHAT to STKR for 8dec2006.

<p>This brings up the idea of plotting software to look at the residuals.  
I like to use a Win32 version of "gnuplot 4.0",
available at
<a href="http://www.gnuplot.info">"gnuplot central"</a>. 
It does have a learning curve, but it's freeware.  To help a little bit, here
is an example gnuplot residual plot file, <a href="sddffx.plt">sddffx.plt</a>.

<p>Shortcomings</a></h4>

<p>This is "no frills" software.  There are no warranties of any sort.
No Windows GUI.  Just the core function.

<p>You must have the 2 input files with the names above.  The program will
overwrite any existing "sddffx.lst" and "sddffx.out" file in the working directory.

<p>The program is single frequency, L1-only.
The program does not currently apply any ionosphere
correction, or a troposphere model.  Results will degrade with distance.
Also, the double differences are treated as uncorrelated.
