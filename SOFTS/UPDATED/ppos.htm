<p>The program, <em>ppos</em>, takes a RINEX observation file and a RINEX navigation file
(broadcast orbit), 
and computes a point position for every epoch.  Optionally, one can also process with 
precise orbits in the SP3 format.  The program also provides for options in processing;
such as use of a simple troposphere model, and vertical angle cutoff of low satellites.

<p>Operation</a></h4>

<p>First, you will need to compile this puppy.  The compiler (and run time
environment) is available (for free) at www.javasoft.com.  Use the standard
edition API (micro is for tiny devices, and enterprise is for business).
After download, installation is a two-click operation.  To compile, put the
Java source in a subdirectory, and compile <em>ppos.java</em> in a DOS window:

<pre>
> javac ppos.java       <------- WARNING -- case sensitive
</pre>

<p>To execute in the DOS window, type:

<pre>
> java ppos             <------- WARNING -- do not add .java extention here
</pre>

<p>Two files are needed for input, and one file is optional for input.
First, the program will prompt for the RINEX observation file name.
Next, it will ask for the RINEX navigation file name.
Then, it will ask if you have a precise orbit file.  It's optional, but if you
have an SP3 format file, go for it.

<p>The program will ask if you want to use 2 frequency pseudoranges for ionosphere
correction.  Don't say "Y" unless you really have dual frequency RINEX data to begin
with.  If the answer was "N", then the program will ask if you want to use the
broadcast ionosphere model, instead.  
You can say yes (Y), but you may want to check your RINEX navigation file to make
sure it has two lines of ionosphere model coefficients in the header.  The program
will ask if you want to apply a simple troposphere model.  (This is a good thing, it
reduces systematic error in heights.)  And, finally, it asks what to use as a 
vertical angle cutoff in degrees.  10 to 15 degrees is a good choice.  89.9 degrees
will likely throw away all of your data. 

<p>One file is generated as output.  It's name is <em>outfile</em>.
The files must be in the subdirectory where you are
working.

<p>Input Files:

<p>An ASCII, RINEX format observation file.

<p>An ASCII, RINEX format navigation file.  This file is also used as a source for
broadcast ionosphere model.  Believe it or not, not all RINEX navigation files out
on the net have the ionosphere coefficients.  Also, believe it or not, for a very
long time, IGS distributed incorrect ionosphere coefficients.  This was due to a
long dormant bug in TEQC based on beta documentation of the placement of the iono 
coefficients in the broadcast message.

<p>(optional) An ASCII, SP3 format, precise orbit.

<p>Output File:

<p><em>outfile</em> -- ASCII, "outfile" format.  This is the coordinate solution
of the L1 phase center
(also, receiver clock bias is solved) for each epoch of data.  DOP's are also output.

<p>Discussion:

<p>Every effort was made to adhere to the ICD-GPS-200.  Of course, the ICD does not
document use of SP3 precise orbits.  On the other hand, while the ICD does indicate
use of a troposphere model, one is not specified.  <em>ppos</em> uses a generic 
seasonal model (Tom Herring, MIT) for temperature, pressure, humidity; which feeds
the Saastamoinen model for zenith delay; which goes into the Herring mapping 
functions (wet and dry) to get total delay along a given slant path.

<p>RINEX Format</a></h4>

<p>The RINEX version 2.10 format (25jan2002) can be obtained from the 
<a href="http://igscb.jpl.nasa.gov/newformats.html">International GPS Service</a>
and the 8jun2001 version from the
<a href="http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/CORS/rinex210.txt">National Geodetic Survey</a>.

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h4><a name="link2"><hr>
<p>SP3 Format</a></h4>

<p>Precise orbits are distributed in a format called SP3.
The format is available from
<a href="http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/GPS/SP3_format.html">NGS</a> and 
<a href="sp3fmt.txt">here</a>.  If you need the orbits themselves, they are
easy to get from NGS at their 
<a href="http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/CORS/">CORS</a> site. 

<p>Here is a sample <a href="igs10711.sp3.txt">igs10711.sp3</a> (316K) SP3 orbit.
It is a precise orbit solution computed by the International GPS Service (IGS).
(It was also concatenated with the next day's orbit.)
Note that if there is an entry of "999999.999999" in the clock field, then that 
satellite can't be used for that epoch.

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h4><a name="link3"><hr>
<p><em>outfile</em> Format</a></h4>

<p>This is a simple ASCII, flat file.  One record per epoch.  Position
of the L1 phase center.

<pre>
01-10  time, seconds past midnight, GPS time
12-13  number of satellites in solution
16-25  geodetic latitude,  decimal degrees, positive north
28-38  geodetic longitude, decimal degrees, positive east
41-50  ellipsoidal height, meters, positive up
53-56  PDOP, unitless, computed with all satellites in view
59-62  HDOP,     "                    "
65-68  VDOP,     "                    "
</pre>

<p>Here is a sample <a href="outfile.txt"><em>outfile</em></a>.  It was
extracted from the first hour of results from the CORS station ERLA
for 17jul2000.  The data were processed with single frequency, broadcast
ionosphere, the troposphere model, and precise SP3 format orbits from IGS.

<p>Shortcomings</a></h4>

<p>This is "no frills" software.  There are no warranties of any sort.
No Windows GUI.  Just the core function.

<p>You must have the 2 input files with the names above.  The program will
overwrite any existing "outfile" file in the working directory.

<p>If there is significant GPS receiver clock drift, the program will 
eventually degrade in performance.  How bad?  The GPS sats travel at 
around 4,000 m/s.  So, to keep clock drift orbit error under 1 m, you don't
want more than 0.25 millisecond.  Handhelds, even with temperature calibrated
oscillators, really drift.  So, I like to correct the time tags and observables 
in the RINEX file.  Some receivers, such as the CMC Superstar, do this 
automatically (depending on collection mode).  Sometime in the future, 
I may alter <em>ppos</em> to make
it robust against major clock drift in the RINEX file.  (So much fun, so 
little time...)

<p>The program does not currently apply solid Earth tide corrections.  This
is below pseudorange noise level (about 1 meter peak-to-peak), but could show
up if some long time series at a static site were analyzed.  (Also on my list
of things to do.)

<p>The program does use all satellites in view, but it does not apply any 
robust estimation to drop outliers.  It does not downweight low elevation angle
satellites (low satellites are subject to ionosphere, troposphere, multipath error).
However, such satellites can be withheld from the solutions.
The software does not use a Kalman filter to refine position (or estimate velocity).
And, no carrier-aided smoothing is applied.  The program does not apply the 
geometric corrections for difference between L1 and L2 phase centers, nor 
the variation of phase center with vertical angle.

<p>Next are PDF reports describing GPS (and WAAS) performance.  Their GPS PAN archive index is incomplete,
but the reports are present in the "reports" directory.  For example: GPS PAN report #47 can be found at:
http://www.nstb.tc.faa.gov/reports/pan47_1004.pdf   For the GPS PAN reports, pay particular attention to 
Figures 5-1 and 5-2.  Also, monitor site behavior is broken out in Table 5-1.  Note that the "Predictable
Accuracy" values quoted in their Appendix A's are based on the <em>worst</em> monitor site in the quarter.
