<p>Operation</a></h4>

<p>The <em>solid.exe</em> program runs in a DOS window.
It prompts for date and location, and creates the file <em>solid.txt</em>. 
Example of how to run the program:

<pre>
   solid
</pre>

<p>The program will first ask for a year, a month number, and a day.

<!-- Dates must range from 1980-jan-06 through 2016-dec-30. -->
Dates must range from 1980-jan-06 through 2017-jun-29.

The program will then ask for a geodetic (ellipsoidal) latitude and
longitude.  An Earth-centered, GRS80 ellipsoid is used.  (Which can be
considered equivalent to the WGS84 ellipsoid at the sub-millimeter level.)

<p>One file is generated as output.  It's name is <em>solid.txt</em>.
If you have an existing <em>solid.txt</em> file in your subdirectory, then
the old file will be overwritten.
You can cancel the program by pressing "ctrl" and "c" at the
same time.  (However, program <em>solid</em> runs so fast that you will not have
a chance to cancel it.)

Input latitude is in decimal degrees, positive North.
Input longitude is in decimal degrees, positive East, and may
range from -360.0 to +360.0.  Thus, 91.5W may be entered
as either -91.5 or +268.5.

<p>Output File:

<p>The output file name is <em>solid.txt</em>.
It is plain ASCII text.  After the header, solid earth tide components
are computed for 24 hours, at 1 minute intervals.  Note: the
time stamps refer to GPS time, not civil time.
The solid earth tide components are North, East, Up in the local
geodetic (ellipsoidal) horizon system.

<p>Discussion</a></h4>

<p>Everybody is used to the ocean tide.  The pull of the Moon and the Sun on the 
ocean causes cyclic variations in local sea level that can exceed 10 meters in some places.

<p>What is less well known is that the Earth itself also responds to lunisolar 
gravitational attraction.  The solid earth tide (body tide) often reaches
+/- 20 cm, and can exceed 30 cm.  While ocean tides can be easily measured 
relative to the solid Earth, solid earth tides are easily measured only with 
satellite systems or sensitive gravimeters.  Also, the solid earth tide 
is a very smooth function around the Earth.  For this reason, differential 
positioning systems, such as differential carrier phase GPS, can frequently 
ignore solid earth tide effects.  Global geodetic networks and GPS carrier phase
precise point positioning must include the effect of solid earth tide.

<p>Program <em>solid</em> is based on an edited version of the <em>dehanttideinelMJD.f</em> 
source code provided by Professor V. Dehant.  This code is an implementation of 
the solid earth tide computation found in section 7.1.2 of the

<!-- <a href="http://62.161.69.131/iers/conv2003/conv2003.html">IERS Conventions (2003)</a> -->
<a href="https://www.iers.org/IERS/EN/Publications/TechnicalNotes/tn32.html">IERS Conventions (2003)</a>

, IERS Technical Note No. 32.

<p>A few words are in order about the editing.  <em>dehanttideinelMJD.f</em>
contains entries that are not found in Table 7.5a of the Conventions.  These 
entries, which are smaller than 0.05 mm, are retained.  However, whenever a 
<em>dehanttideinelMJD.f</em> entry differed from Table 7.5a of the Conventions, 
irrespective of magnitude, the Table 7.5a value was used.

<p><em>Solid</em> is invoked in the GPS time system.  Note that this time system differs 
from both universal time and terrestrial time (ephemeris time).  GPS time is 
converted into terrestrial time before calling the Step 2 computations.  

<p><em>Solid</em> is driven by a pair of routines that compute low-precision geocentric 
coordinates for the Moon and the Sun.  These routines were coded from the 
equations in "<em>Satellite Orbits: Models, Methods, Applications</em>" by Montenbruck & 
Gill (2000), section 3.3.2, pp.70-73.
One may also refer to "<em>Astronomy on the Personal Computer</em>", 4th ed. by 
Montenbruck & Pfleger (2005), section 3.2, pp.38-39.  This reference 
explains that the distinction between universal time (UTC) and terrestrial time 
(TT) is negligible for these low-precision functions.  Even so, <em>solid</em> does include 
the conversions between GPS time, UTC, and TT.  Since leap seconds are involved 
in the conversions, users will need to edit the source code to incorporate 
future leap seconds (i.e. after 
<!-- following refers to latest leap second -->
<!-- following refers to latest leap second -->
<!-- following refers to latest leap second -->
<!-- June 30, 2015). -->
December 31, 2016).

<p>In keeping with the design of <em>dehanttideinelMJD.f</em>, program <em>solid</em>
removes all tidal deformation, both cyclic and permanent.
More detail on this point can be found
in the section below on <a href="#link4">permanent earth tide</a>.
<em>Solid</em> implements the conventions described in Section 7.1.2 of the

<a href="https://www.iers.org/IERS/EN/Publications/TechnicalNotes/tn32.html">IERS Conventions (2003)</a>
.

<em>Solid</em> does
not implement ocean loading, atmospheric loading, or deformation due to polar motion,
which are described in other sections of the Conventions.

<p>Permanent Earth Tide</a></h4>

<p><font size=-1>
Fine Print:
This section is not for the faint of heart.
It can be skipped unless you <em>really</em> want to see the details involved in the
creation and maintenance of global geodetic networks.
</font>

<p>Lets begin with a fact discovered by Darwin in 1899.

<p><B>Tides of the Earth do not average to zero.</B>

<p>This gives us a quick corollary.

<p><B>Tidal deformation of the Earth does not average out to zero.</B>

<p>The easiest way to imagine this is to pretend that the Moon and Sun orbit around 
the Earth.  Imagine them orbiting faster and faster, so that, on the average, 
they are "smeared" into bands around the Earth.  Alternatively, you can imagine 
the Moon and Sun as chopped into tiny bits and spread around the Earth in a 
two-band system.  These "average bands" will cause a permanent gravitational 
attraction leading to an increased equatorial bulge of the non-rigid Earth.  In 
other words, most of the Earth’s equatorial bulge is due to the Earth’s 
rotation.  But, there is a portion of the bulge that is created by the 
average tug of the Moon and Sun.  The average attraction is called the permanent
tide, and the associated effect on the Earth’s equatorial
bulge is called the permanent tidal deformation (PTD).

<p>Here is the second fact that makes this particularly complex.

<p><B>The permanent tidal deformation is unobservable.</B>

<p>We know that the permanent deformation exists.  And, satellite (and gravity, and 
VLBI) systems tell us about the Earth’s equatorial bulge and its variations.  
But, these systems tell us about the *total* bulge, and not how it is 
partitioned between the rotational part and the permanent tidal part.  If there 
were a way to magically eliminate the Moon and Sun, then we could observe a 
"before-and-after" effect, and establish the magnitude of the permanent tidal 
deformation (PTD).

<p>Now, its possible to make an educated guess on how big the PTD is.  It happens that radial 
deformation is related to disturbing gravitational potential through a quantity 
called a
<a href="http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/LoveNumber.html">Love number</a>.
(There are also Shida numbers that relate horizontal displacement to 
potential.)  Through theory and indirect measurements, nominal values for Love 
and Shida numbers were established.  Using these nominal values, one could 
compute PTD, since the masses and motions of the Moon and Sun were known.  At 
its heart, though, these computations are based on a model.

<p>PTD became an issue for geodesists in 1959 when Honkasalo presented
a paper on correction of gravity data.  The Honkasalo correction 
restored the permanent tide that was removed in the tide correction
procedure.  In this way, only the truly cyclic tidal elements were
removed.  This approach was called a "mean tide" system, and was used in
computation of the global gravity network, IGSN71.

<p>However, this retention of permanent tide violated theory that called for
removal of external masses when computing the equipotential surface of the Earth
(Heikkinen 1979).
This caused the
<a href="http://www.iag-aig.org/">International Association of Geodesy (IAG)</a>
to resolve in 1979 
to revert to the previous practice of tide correction, and remove the permanent
tidal effects along with the periodic effects.  This is 
designated as a "non-tidal" or "tide-free" system.

<p>A plot of the radial difference between these two permanent tide systems
can be found in <a href="ptd.png">Figure 1</a>.
The systems differ from +6 cm at the equator to -12 cm at the poles.
The horizontal component (not shown) is 0 at the pole and equator, and reaches 2.5 cm at mid-latitude.

<p>If one removes the Earth’s displacement due to the permanent tide, the PTD, 
then one gets errors in the model for the Earth’s length of day.
It was proposed that one 
remove all tidal effects (tide-free) but then restore only the permanent tidal 
deformation and the associated changes in the Earth’s potential associated with 
that restored deformation.  This re-reverts back to a mean tide system for
station coordinates.  And, it creates a new, "zero tide" system for the geopotential.
This was adopted by the IAG in 1983.  

<p>This resolution has <em>not</em> met with widespread acceptance.  The situation is
described in the
<!-- <a href="http://62.161.69.131/iers/conv2003/conv2003.html">IERS Conventions (2003)</a> -->
<a href="https://www.iers.org/IERS/EN/Publications/TechnicalNotes/tn32.html">IERS Conventions (2003)</a>

, IERS Technical Note No. 32, Section 1.1, page 10:

<p><font size=-1>
This recommendation, however, has not been implemented in the algorithms used for
tide modeling by the geodesy community in the analysis of space geodetic
data in general.  As a consequence, the station coordinates that go with such
analyses (see Chapter 4) are "conventional tide free" values.
</font>

<p>Thus, in conformance with the IERS Conventions, both <em>dehanttideinelMJD.f</em> and 
program <em>solid</em> compute <em>all</em> tidal deformation, both cyclic and permanent.
As such, they realize a "conventional tide free" system.

<p>Where does this leave us?

<p>We have an effect that is sometimes negligible, is unobservable, but is non-zero and
imbedded in various reference systems.  Know that there are multiple ways of handling
PTD.  And, know that PTD is, indeed, handled differently in practice.  The good news is
that one may readily transform geometric and gravimetric quantities between the
permanent tide systems.

Footnote:

<p>In time it was found that Love numbers vary with tidal frequency,
and that Love numbers for PTD (fluid limit Love numbers; e.g. Lambeck, 1980)
were different from nominal (conventional) values. Even so, these newer Love
numbers for PTD are based on indirect measurements and models.  They would
enable an alternative mean tide system and zero tide system to the 
"conventional mean tide" system and "conventional zero tide" system.

<p>Footnote:

<p>To get the full flavor of the PTD effect, understand that one gets two
pieces when considering gravity and potential --

<ul>
  <li>External (direct) potential -- caused by the Sun and Moon</li>
  <li>Indirect potential -- caused by tidal deformation of the Earth</li>
</ul>

These, in combination, generate another way to handle the tides systems for
gravitational factors (i.e. zero tide).  The geometric PTD only sets up two
permanent tide systems.  The

<p>Shortcomings</a></h4>

<p>This is "no frills" software.  There are no warranties of any sort.
No Windows GUI.  Just the core function.

<p>This program is written as a demonstration and a way of applying a
reasonable solid earth tide correction.  It's expected that this software
could be imbedded into other applications.

<p>To create a full blown, research-grade code, more effects could
be added.  Program <em>solid</em> does not contain
ocean loading, atmospheric loading, or deformation due to polar motion.
Also, one would want a more accurate set of routines to compute the geocentric
positions of the Moon and the Sun.
