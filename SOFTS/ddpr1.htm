<p>The program, <em>ddpr1</em>, takes two RINEX files (both static), a precise orbit in
SP3 format, a <em>pos</em> file of reference coordinates, and computes the position of 
point 2 using single frequency (L1), double difference pseudoranges.

<p>Operation</a></h4>

<p>The program operates in the DOS window.  Alternatively, you can simply
run "ddpr1.exe" with a double click or with "Run..." in your "Start" menu.
(I use the DOS window myself.)

<p>Four files are needed for input.  Two files are generated as output.  
The names are fixed.  The files must be in the subdirectory where you are
working.

<p>Input Files:

<p><em>point1.rnx</em> -- ASCII, RINEX format.  This point is treated
as a base station, and is considered known.

<p><em>point2.rnx</em> -- ASCII, RINEX format.  This point is treated
as the unknown station.

<p><em>orbit.sp3</em> -- ASCII, SP3 format, precise orbit.

<p><em>pos</em> -- ASCII, special format, described below.  This file holds
reference coordinates for known stations.  For example, one could put 
coordinates for local CORS stations in this file.  If ddpr1.exe doesn't
find a 4 character ID in the <em>pos</em> file, it will use the coordinate
in the RINEX header, instead.  But, while ddpr1.exe is not picky, it is 
mandatory to have a <em>pos</em> file.

<p>Output Files:

<p><em>ddpr1.lst</em> -- ASCII, output listing.  This contains the coordinate solution
of the L1 phase center and some statistics.

<p><em>ddpr1.res</em> -- ASCII, residual listing.  These are the residuals, in the
sense of observed-computed, for every satellite, every epoch.

<p>Discussion:

<p>The double difference pseudorange is something of a "classic" solution.
The double difference cancels clock error in the GPS satellites (tiny) and
in the GPS receivers (not tiny).  What's left is orbit error, atmospheric
error, and local (multipath and noise).  Bottom line, double differences have 
a slow increase in error when increasing station separation.  This makes double
difference pseudorange superior to DGPS, and why some manufacturers use it
as a post-processing option.  Precise orbits are very good, 
leaving atmosphere error (iono and tropo) and multipath error in the residuals.

<p>This version, <em>ddpr1</em>, is a static solution.  
The data are scanned and a table is built of the reference (highest)
satellites.  Then, the double differences are 
grouped by PRN by writing and reading "scatter-gather" temporary files.
Only 3 unknowns are solved, the location of point 2.  The solution iterates, 
bypassing outlier observations.  Here is an example <a href="ddpr1.lst">ddpr1.lst</a>.

<p>RINEX Format</a></h4>

<p>The RINEX version 2.10 format (25jan2002) can be obtained from the 
<a href="http://igscb.jpl.nasa.gov/newformats.html">International GPS Service</a>
and the 8jun2001 version from the
<a href="http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/CORS/rinex210.txt">National Geodetic Survey</a>.

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h4><a name="link2"><hr>
<p>SP3 Format</a></h4>

<p>The program does require the precise orbit, <em>orbit.sp3</em>, to
span the common RINEX data interval.  Since IGS distributes orbits with
only 96 epochs/daily file, if you take data in the last 15 minutes of a
GPS day, then the program will crash.  Either delete the last piece of 
data, or get a 192 epoch, concatenated precise orbit from any 24 hour
data retreival from the 
<a href="http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/cgi-cors/ufcors2.prl">UFCORS</a>
at the National Geodetic Survey.

<p>Precise orbits are distributed in a format called SP3.
The format is available from
<a href="http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/GPS/SP3_format.html">NGS</a> and 
<a href="sp3fmt.txt">here</a>.  If you need the orbits themselves, they are
easy to get from NGS at their 
<a href="http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/CORS/">CORS</a> site. 

<p>Here is a sample <a href="igs10711.sp3.txt">igs10711.sp3</a> (316K) SP3 orbit.
It is a precise orbit solution computed by the International GPS Service (IGS).
(It was also concatenated with the next day's orbit.)
Note that if there is an entry of "999999.999999" in the clock field, then that 
satellite can't be used for that epoch.

<p><em>pos</em> Format</a></h4>

<p>This is a simple ASCII, flat file.  Two records per station.  
The file name is very simple, "pos" -- no extention.  This file
functions as a mini-database of authoritative coordinates.  The file is
mandatory.  However, if a given station is not found in the <em>pos</em> file,
then the RINEX header is used for station coordinates instead.

<p>The format is a simple adaptation of the National Geodetic Survey "Blue Book"
format.

<pre>
ASCII, 2 records per station.

Record 1
--------
01-04  4 character station ID, case sensitive.  Must match ID in RINEX header
05-06  blank
07-10  *80*
11-14  blank
15-44  station name
45-46  geodetic latitude, degrees            (corrected 2008may14)
47-48     "        "    , minutes
49-55     "        "    , units of 0.00001 arc-seconds
56-56  (N/S) -- "N" positive north, "S" positive south
57-59  geodetic longitude, degrees
60-61     "         "    , minutes
62-68     "         "    , units of 0.00001 arc-seconds
69-69  (W/E) -- "W" positive west, "E" positive east

Record 2
--------
01-06  blank
07-10  *86*
11-45  blank
46-52  ellipsoidal height, units of millimeters

<p>Residual File</a></h4>

<p><em>ddpr1.res</em> is a simple ASCII, flat file.  One record per double
difference residual.

<pre>
01-09  time, seconds past midnight, GPS time
10-18  double difference pseudorange residual error, meters, (observed-computed)
19-24  vertical angle, decimal degrees, positive up
26-27  PRN of satellite 2 (see ddpr1.lst for table of reference satellites).
</pre>

<p>Here is a sample <a href="ddpr1.res.txt"><em>ddpr1.res</em></a>.  It was
extracted from the first hour of results from the CORS stations MIA3 to AOML
for 20jan2002.

<p>This brings up the idea of plotting software to look at the residuals.  
I like to use a Win32 version of "gnuplot 3.7",
available at
<a href="http://www.gnuplot.info">"gnuplot central"</a>.  
It does have a learning curve, but it's freeware.  To help a little bit, here
is an example gnuplot residual plot file, <a href="ddprres.plt">ddprres.plt</a>.

<p>Shortcomings</a></h4>

<p>This is "no frills" software.  There are no warranties of any sort.
No Windows GUI.  Just the core function.

<p>You must have the 4 input files with the names above.  The program will
overwrite any existing "ddpr1.lst" or "ddpr1.res" files in the working directory.

<p><em>ddpr1</em> is not careful about the antenna offsets between an ARP
and the L1 phase center (or phase center variation with vertical angle).
So, it should only be considered for use between L1 phase center 
positions (note: <a href="#link3"><em>pos</em> file</a>).

<p>The program does not currently apply any ionosphere
correction, or a troposphere model.  Results will degrade with distance.
Also, the double differences are treated as uncorrelated.

<p>Source Code and Binary Executable</a></h4>

<p>The Fortran source code is <a href="ddpr1.for.txt">ddpr1.for</a>.

<p>The compiled executable (zipped) is <a href="ddpr1.zip">ddpr1.exe</a>.

<p>Fixed a coordinate conversion bug for southern hemisphere (2005-sep-17).
