<h2><strong>MERGE TWO RINEX FILES</strong></h2>

<p>RINEX files are interesting animals.  The identity of columns varies from
file to file.  The satellites are in any order, and can change order from epoch
to epoch.  And, of course, data can start and stop at any time, and be logged
at different rates at different sites.  RINEX is easy to write, but it takes
work to read.

<p>The program, <em>gmerge</em>, takes two RINEX files, and merges them into a single
file in a format that I like.  Its ASCII in, and ASCII out.  Also, a position
file, <em>pos</em>, and an antenna file, <em>ant</em>, are read to set up the file header.

<p>Operation</a></h4>

<p>The program operates in the DOS window.  Alternatively, you can simply
run "gmerge.exe" with a double click or with "Run..." in your "Start" menu.
(I use the DOS window myself.)

<p>Four files are needed for input.  One file is generated as output.  
The names are fixed.  The files must be in the subdirectory where you are
working.

<p>Input Files:

<p><em>point1.rnx</em> -- ASCII, RINEX format.  This point is treated
as a base station by my some of my programs.

<p><em>point2.rnx</em> -- ASCII, RINEX format.  This point is treated
as a rover or unknown station by my some of my programs.

<p><em>pos</em> -- ASCII, special format, described below.  This file holds
reference coordinates for known stations.  For example, one could put 
coordinates for local CORS stations in this file.  If gmerge.exe doesn't
find a 4 character ID in the <em>pos</em> file, it will use the coordinate
in the RINEX header, instead.  But, while gmerge.exe is not picky, it is 
mandatory to have a <em>pos</em> file.

<p><em>ant</em> -- ASCII, NGS format, described below.  This file holds
antenna phase center (ARP/L1/L2) relations and phase center variations
with vertical angle.  This file is an exact copy of <em>ant_info.003</em>,
maintained by the National Geodetic Survey.  If gmerge.exe doesn't
find an antenna ID in the <em>ant</em> file, it will assume that the L1
(and L2) phase centers are coincident with the Antenna Reference Point 
(ARP) and that there is no phase center variation with vertical angle.  
As before, gmerge.exe is not picky, but it is mandatory to have an <em>ant</em> file.

<p>Output File:

<p><em>gmerge.out</em> -- ASCII, "gmerge" format.  This is merged pseudorange
and carrier phase, at a common interval and data rate.  The header is generated
with the best available information on coordinates and antenna properties.

<p>Discussion:

<p>The program is pretty straightforward.  It reformats data from two different
RINEX inputs.  The WGS84 ellipsoid is used; but it can be considered the same
as the GRS80 ellipsoid at the sub-millimeter level.  Nothing is done about
reference frame origins.  The ITRF frames are not the same as the NAD 83  
frame (to the tune of a couple of meters).  So, don't mix and match ITRF and
NAD 83 in your "pos" file unless you know what you are doing.

<p>A note on operation: <em>gmerge</em> will preferentially output the P(Y)
pseudorange over a C/A pseudorange on L1.

<p>I am in a gradual (very gradual) process of converting my software to
work with the <em>gmerge</em> format, instead of directly with RINEX files.

<p>RINEX Format</a></h4>

<p>The RINEX version 2.10 format (25jan2002) can be obtained from the 
<a href="http://igscb.jpl.nasa.gov/newformats.html">International GPS Service</a>
and the 8jun2001 version from the
<a href="http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/CORS/rinex210.txt">National Geodetic Survey</a>.

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h4><a name="link2"><hr>
<p><em>pos</em> Format</a></h4>

<p>This is a simple ASCII, flat file.  Two records per station.  
The file name is very simple, "pos" -- no extention.  This file
functions as a mini-database of authoritative coordinates.  The file is
mandatory.  However, if a given station is not found in the <em>pos</em> file,
then the RINEX header is used for station coordinates instead.

<p>The format is a simple adaptation of the National Geodetic Survey "Blue Book"
format.

<pre>
ASCII, 2 records per station.

Record 1
--------
01-04  4 character station ID, case sensitive.  Must match ID in RINEX header
05-06  blank
07-10  *80*
11-14  blank
15-44  station name
11-45  blank
46-47  geodetic latitude, degrees
48-49     "        "    , minutes
50-55     "        "    , units of 0.00001 arc-seconds
56-56  (N/S) -- "N" positive north, "S" positive south
57-59  geodetic longitude, degrees
60-61     "         "    , minutes
62-68     "         "    , units of 0.00001 arc-seconds
69-69  (W/E) -- "W" positive west, "E" positive east

Record 2
--------
01-06  blank
07-10  *86*
11-45  blank
46-52  ellipsoidal height, units of millimeters

<p>Here is an example <a href="pos.txt"><em>pos</em> file</a>.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h4><a name="link3"><hr>
<p><em>ant</em> Format</a></h4>

<p>This is a simple ASCII, flat file.
The file name is very simple, "ant" -- no extention.  This file
is a database of GPS receiver antenna information.  It provides the
relations of the L1 and L2 phase centers to the ARP (antenna reference
point), and it shows the variation of the phase centers relative to
vertical angle.  The file is
mandatory.  However, if a given antenna is not found in the <em>ant</em> file,
then zero relations are used instead (for example, antenna "NONE").

<p>The <em>ant</em> file is an exact copy of the National Geodetic Survey 
<a href="http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/ANTCAL/">"ant_info.003"</a> relative 
antenna calibration file.

<p>The ant_info.003 file is also here: <a href="ant_info.003.txt">ant</a>.
Just put it into a file named <em>ant</em>.

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h4><a name="link4"><hr>
<p><em>gmerge</em> Format</a></h4>

<p>This is a simple ASCII, flat file.  The header contains exactly 14 records.
The 14-th record indicates how many epoch sets follow.

<p>Each epoch set consists of an epoch header and a number of data records.
There is one data record for each satellite in the epoch.

<p>Here is the detailed <a href="gmerge.fmt.txt">gmerge format</a> file.

<p>Here is a sample <a href="gmerge.out.txt">gmerge.out</a> file.  It was
generated between two CORS stations, SEAT to SEAW, for 3 epochs of
data.  Note the null values (99999999.999) generated whenever a given data 
element is not available.  Time is in seconds from midnight (GPS time) of
the day in the first record of the file (20jan2002).

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h4><a name="link5"><hr>
<p>Shortcomings</a></h4>

<p>This is "no frills" software.  There are no warranties of any sort.
No Windows GUI.  Just the core function.

<p>You must have the 4 input files with the names above.  The program will
overwrite any existing "gmerge.out" file in the working directory.

<p>There is no support for GLONASS satellites.  No more than 12 GPS satellites
are assumed in view at any time.  No more than 2 RINEX obs records per satellite
are allowed (i.e. 10 observation types).  Does not support 
WAAS transmitted pseudoranges.  Epochs considered synchronized using a 
tolerance of 0.3 seconds.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h4><a name="linkx"><hr>
<p>Source Code and Binary Executable</a></h4>

<p>The Fortran source code is <a href="gmerge.for.txt">gmerge.for</a>.

<p>The compiled executable (zipped) is <a href="gmerge.zip">gmerge.exe</a>.

<p>Fixed a coordinate conversion bug for southern hemisphere (2005-sep-17).

<p>Fixed a longitude header display bug for eastern hemisphere (2005-dec-16).

<p>Truncate high-order phase cycles that exceed null (99999999.999) (2008-apr-13).

<p>My e-mail user name is the first initial of my first name
followed by all the letters of my last name (see above).  My ISP is
"comcast", and it is a "dot-net", not a "dot-com".  Sorry for not spelling
out my e-mail address, but I try to keep the spam-bots
from fingering me.  But, just so the spam-bots don't feel left
out, they can always go to abuse@comcast.net
