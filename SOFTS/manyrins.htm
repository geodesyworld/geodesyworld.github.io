<p>RINEX files are interesting animals.  The identity of columns varies from
file to file.  The satellites are in any order, and can change order from epoch
to epoch.  And, of course, data can start and stop at any time, and be logged
at different rates at different sites.  RINEX is easy to write, but it takes
work to read.

<p>The program, <em>manyrins</em>, takes multiple RINEX files, and merges them into a single
file in a format that I like.  Its ASCII in, and ASCII out.  Also, a list
file, <em>list.txt</em>, is input to identify the file names of the RINEX files
to be merged.

<p>Operation</a></h4>

<p>The program operates in the DOS console window.  
You can spawn a console window from the "Start" menu by going through:
<pre>
   Start --> All Programs --> Accessories --> Command Prompt.
</pre>

Aside from the RINEX files you wish to merge, only one additional file
is needed.  It is a simple ASCII list of the file names of the RINEX
files.  Only one output file is generated.

<p>Input Files:

<p><em>list.txt</em> -- ASCII.  A simple list, created by Notepad (for
example) of the file names of the RINEX files. This file must be named
<em>list.txt</em>.  One RINEX observation file name per line.
If an asterisk, *, is in column 1 of a line, then that line is skipped.

<p>Example:
<pre>
colb1890.12o
ohmh1890.12o
stkr1890.12o
wtzz1890.12o
</pre>

<p><em>many RINEX file names</em> -- ASCII, RINEX format.  
These will be the RINEX observation files to be merged.  The files must
all be present in the same subdirectory/folder as program <em>manyrins.exe</em>
and the list file, <em>list.txt</em>.  The RINEX files must not be compressed.

<p><em>manyrins</em> is built to merge single-day files on the same day.  
Unexpected behaviors 
will occur if RINEX files spanning two or more days are encountered.  
<em>manyrins</em> should have correct operation if a file has just a second or two
of data in the previous day or the next day.  In other words, <em>manyrins</em>
merges RINEX files for multiple stations.  If you need to merge RINEX files
in time, I can heartily recommend
<a href="http://facility.unavco.org/software/teqc/">TEQC</a>. 

<p><em>manyrins</em> supports RINEX formats up to and including 2.12. 
<em>manyrins</em> does not currently support RINEX formats of 3.00 or higher.

<p>Output File:

<p><em>manyrins.txt</em> -- ASCII, "<em>manyrins</em>" format.  A single output file
containing the merged contents of the input RINEX observation files.  The output
file name is fixed as <em>manyrins.txt</em>.  It will be written into the same
subdirectory as the input files.


<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

<p>Program Execution</a></h4>

<p><em>manyrins</em> takes 3 command line arguments.  Each argument is 
an integer number, in seconds.  All 3 arguments are mandatory.

<p>Command Line:
<pre>
manyrins startTime stopTime interval
</pre>

<p>Example:
<pre>
manyrins 0 86400 30
</pre>

<p><em>startTime</em> -- The start time of the output data; an integer, expressing
seconds-of day, in units of seconds.  Allowed range of 0 to 86400.  Note that
<em>startTime</em> must be less than or equal to <em>stopTime</em>.

<p><em>stopTime</em> -- The stop time of the output data; an integer, expressing
seconds-of day, in units of seconds.  Allowed range of 0 to 86400.  Note that
<em>stopTime</em> must be greater than or equal to <em>startTime</em>.

<p><em>interval</em> -- The interval of the output data; an integer, expressing
time between output epochs, in units of seconds.  Allowed range of 0 to 86400.  Note that
<em>interval</em> must be less than or equal to the difference between
 <em>stopTime</em> and <em>startTime</em>.

<p>Even if a small <em>startTime</em> or a large <em>stopTime</em> are specified,
 <em>manyrins</em> will only
output epochs that have data, and will adjust the output start and stop
times to reflect the input RINEX files.

<p>Discussion:

<p>From the user perspective, the program is pretty straightforward.  
It reformats data from many different
RINEX inputs.  It uses <em>list.txt</em> to look for RINEX file names.  It 
opens each file, and reads the data into memory.  Then it outputs the data
into the <em>manyrins.txt</em> output file.  There is a built in limit of
1000 input files.  You may encounter the limit sooner depending on how much
data is retained in each RINEX file.

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h4><a name="link2"><hr>
<p>RINEX Format</a></h4>

<p>The RINEX formats (2, 2.10, 2.11, 2.12, 3.00, 3.01) can be obtained from the 
<a href="http://igscb.jpl.nasa.gov/igscb/data/format/">International GNSS Service</a>.
Since <em>manyrins</em> supports
<a href="http://igscb.jpl.nasa.gov/igscb/data/format/rinex212.txt">RINEX format 2.12</a>,
that specific link is provided.  Note that the codes span 5 different GNSS satellite
systems, each with 100 possible PRN's.  The codes also span 4 different observation
sets (not counting signal strength) with 10 different subdivisions.  Not all possible
PRN's or observation subdivisions are issued for a given GNSS satellite system.

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h4><a name="link3"><hr>
<p><em>manyrins.txt</em> Format</a></h4>

<p>This is a simple ASCII, flat file.  There is no specific limit on the
number of lines, nor on the number of columns in a line.  The basic
unit of presentation is a two-dimensional array of observations, where the
rows refer to markers/antennae and the columns refer to GNSS satellites.

<p>These data arrays are orgainized in a sequential, hierarchical fashion.
That is, a "chapter" of data refers to a single epoch.  And, a "page"
of data refers to a specific observation type, such as a P1 pseudorange
or an L2 carrier phase, and its associated two-dimensional array.  Just as
a "chapter" consists of one or more "pages", an epoch of data
consists of one or more observation types.

<p>Every record contains a single-character record identifier in the first column.
Record identifiers are detailed below.

<p>The file begins with a set of header records.  The first record is always an "a" record.
It indicates the time span, interval, and number of processed stations.  The "a"
record is followed by one or more "b" records, one for each station.  The "b" records
list the 4-character station identifier, antenna type, H/E/N offsets, and a RINEX code
for the GNSS time system.

<p>After the header are multiple chapters of data, corresponding to each epoch.
The first record in each chapter is always an "e" record -- "Epoch Record".
The epoch records show year, month, day, hour, minutes, and integer seconds in the
GPS time system.

<p>Following the "e" Epoch Record are multiple pages of data, each corresponding to 
a specific observation type.  The first record on a page is always an "f" record.
The record shows the RINEX code for the observation type, the number of rows (one row per 
station), and the number of columns (one column per satellite).  All the data on the
subsequent data array is of the indicated observation type.  Note that each
array on a data page has been condensed to eliminate extraneous stations and satellites.
Hence, the number of rows and columns will vary from observation type-to-observation type
and from epoch-to-epoch.

<p>Each "f" record is followed by one or more "t" records.  There will be one "t" 
record for each row in the data array.  Each "t" record displays the 4-character
station identifier and the logged observation time in the GPS time system.

<p>After the "t" records is a single "s" record.  This record shows the GNSS identifier
(satellite PRN's) for each column of the data array.

<p>Finally, to conclude a data page, is the data array.  The array is made of one or 
more "o" records.  There is one "o" record for every row of the data array.  And the
records contain sufficient columns to reflect each satellite associated with that
specific epoch and observation type.  Note that there will be instances where a given
receiver did not record a particular observation type from a particular satellite at
a particular epoch.  These will be expressed in the data array as a NULL observation.
NULL observations are always displayed as 9999999999.999.

<p>Memory Usage</a></h4>

<p>Recall from above that <em>manyrins</em> opens each RINEX file, reads the data 
into memory, and outputs the data into the <em>manyrins.txt</em> file.  
System memory is a constraint on the amount of input data that can be merged
by <em>manyrins</em>.  To support this constraint, <em>manyrins</em> outputs
a console message indicating the percentage of available memory space used
to process the input data.  For example:

<pre>
program memory use:  1.03596 precent
</pre>

<p>Program <em>manyrins</em> is efficient.  It only stores observations
that fit the "start time/stop time/interval" profile supplied on the
command line.
Depending upon the number of satellites, data spans in the RINEX files,
desired output data span, and observation types that were collected, it
is literally possible for <em>manyrins</em> to merge hundreds of RINEX
files into a single output file.  A software limit of 1000 input RINEX 
files is (currently) used.  The work array sizes in <em>manyrins</em> are
tuned to fit a WIN32 limit.  The source code is available 
<a href="#linkx">(below)</a></li>
and can be ported to other computer systems.

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h4><a name="link5"><hr>
<p>GPS Time System</a></h4>

<p>All times output from <em>manyrins</em> are in a nominal GPS time system.

<p>Times from SBAS (S), Galileo (E), and Compass (C), are already in a nominal
GPS time system.  Program <em>manyrins</em> does not alter those times.

<p>Times from GLONASS (R), however, might be expressed in the GLONASS time
system.  The GLONASS time system is nominally aligned with UTC.
Program <em>manyrins</em> detects the presence of the "R" time system code
(typically found only in "pure" GLONASS-only RINEX files), and converts
the times into nominal GPS time.

<p>Conversion is performed by algebraically adding the leap seconds offset
from the "LEAP SECONDS" record in the RINEX header to the GLONASS times.
It is important that a "LEAP SECONDS" record be present in one of the input
RINEX file headers supplied to <em>manyrins</em> when pure GLONASS files
are processed.  If not present, <em>manyrins</em>
will issue a warning message, and will not convert the GLONASS times.
It is <em>not</em> recommended that the output file be used if the 
warning message is issued.

<p>Depending upon the application, the user may wish to apply finer time
system corrections to the observed times.  To support this option, the
time system identity of each input RINEX file is supplied in the 
<em>manyrins.txt</em> "b" records.
