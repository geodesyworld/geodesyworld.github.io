<h2><strong>CMC SUPERSTAR BINARY TO RINEX</strong></h2>

<p>The program, <em>cmc2rin</em>, takes a binary file from the CMC Superstar
logger, and converts the message #23 contents into a RINEX file.
Its binary in, and ASCII (RINEX) out.

<p>The Superstar board has quite a history.  It started as the Allstar, then
became the Superstar, then became the Superstar II.  (I believe this was due to
evolution of the underlying chipsets by Mitel -- now Zarlink Semiconductor.)
Then, it started moving between companies.
The CMC stood for "Canadian Marconi Company".  This became "CMC Electronics",
then "BAE Systems Canada".  Anyway, the Superstar II is now available from
<a href="http://www.novatel.com">NovAtel</a>.
The April 2006 version supports the NovAtel flavor binary message #23;
since they toggle a high bit to signal between continuous vs. one-shot 
logging modes.

<p>Operation</a></h4>

<p>The program operates in the DOS window.  Alternatively, you can simply
run "cmc2rin.exe" with a double click or with "Run..." in your "Start" menu.
(I use the DOS window myself.)

<p>One file is needed for input.  One file is generated as output.  
The names are fixed.  The files must be in the subdirectory where you are
working.  The program will also ask you for the GPS week #.  This is
necessary, because the #23 messages do not contain the GPS week.

<p>Input File:

<p><em>z.log</em> -- Binary format.  You must have enabled logging of the
#23 messages.  The latest info from UNAVCO says that you should also 
enable logging of the #21 messages (position messages), even if those data
are not used.  Apparently, logging both message types prevents a 
mis-synchronization between the pseudoranges and carrier phases in the 
#23 messages.

<p>Output File:

<p><em>z.obs</em> -- ASCII, RINEX format.  A RINEX observation file 
containing the pseudorange and carrier phase information in the #23 messages.
A generic header is also constructed -- edit those elements you wish to
change (like station ID and approximate position).

<p>Discussion:

<p>The program decimates the input data into one epoch per 5 seconds.

<p>RINEX Format</a></h4>

<p>The RINEX version 2.10 format (25jan2002) can be obtained from the 
<a href="http://igscb.jpl.nasa.gov/newformats.html">International GPS Service</a>
and the 8jun2001 version from the
<a href="http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/CORS/rinex210.txt">National Geodetic Survey</a>.

<p>Shortcomings</a></h4>

<p>This is "no frills" software.  There are no warranties of any sort.
No Windows GUI.  Just the core function.

<p>You must have the input file with the name <em>z.log</em>.  The program will
overwrite any existing "z.obs" file in the working directory.

<p>Source Code and Binary Executable</a></h4>

<p>The Fortran source code (26mar02) is <a href="cmc2rin.for.txt">cmc2rin.for</a>.

<p>The compiled executable (zipped) is <a href="cmc2rin.zip">cmc2rin.exe</a>.

<p>To Contact Me</a></h4>

<p>My e-mail user name is the first initial of my first name
followed by all the letters of my last name (see above).  My ISP is
"comcast", and it is a "dot-net", not a "dot-com".  Sorry for not spelling
out my e-mail address, but I try to keep the spam-bots
from fingering me.  But, just so the spam-bots don't feel left
out, they can always go to abuse@comcast.net
