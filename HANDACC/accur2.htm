<p>Plots and Discussion</a></h4>

<p>The first part of the answer is that there is up to 1 meter (horizontal) of
day to day variation, even when 24 hour datasets are considered.  The
second part of the answer is that the 95% limit is greatly affected by 
unmodeled, systematic error -- so that the 95% limit shows greater variation
than the 50% limit.  Statistically, the 95% limit is a less "robust"
descriptor.  Your performance on any given day, much less any given minute,
is a variable quantity.

<pre>
       Results for a Month  (Garmin GPSMAP 76 -- no WAAS)

   Horizontal Accuracy (50%)    3.1 meters
   Vertical Accuracy   (50%)    4.3 meters
   Horizontal Accuracy (95%)    7.7 meters
   Vertical Accuracy   (95%)   14.3   meters

<p>  The Plots
<ul>
  <li><a href="h502.gif">Horizontal Error (50%)</a></li>
  <li><a href="v502.gif">Vertical Error (50%)</a></li>
  <li><a href="h952.gif">Horizontal Error (95%)</a></li>
  <li><a href="v952.gif">Vertical Error (95%)</a></li>
</ul>

<p>It is satisfying to see that the horizontal and vertical
accuracy vs. precision are virtually indistinguishable.
This is quite a contrast from the

<a href="http://users.erols.com/dmilbert/accur.htm">vertical systematic error</a>

found in the Garmin 12XL.

<p>It is possible to note a slight systematic error in height in the first
half of June.  It was very rainy during that time, and it is possible 
that the troposphere correction could not handle the weather.

<p>It is also possible to note a oscillation in the plots.  Hypothetically, it may
be related to the upload cycles of the broadcast ionosphere model, and to
the behavior of the ionosphere.

<p>The results above are derived from Garmin GPSMAP 76 NMEA sentences.
The horizontal coordinates are expressed to the nearest
0.0001 arc minute in latitude/longitude.  This works out to about
18 centimeters (N/S) and 14 centimeters (E/W).  Height is expressed to
the nearest 0.1 meter.  Note that the horizontal "least count" is
10 times finer than that of the Garmin 12XL.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h4><a name="link2"><hr>
<p>Precision vs. Accuracy</a></h4>

<p>Precision is not the same as accuracy.  Accuracy is a measure of departure
from the true value of a quantity.  Precision, on the other hand, is a 
measure of the "repeatability" of the data.  The difference between accuracy
and precision is known as "bias" or "systematic error".  Taking large amounts
of data will improve the precision of a sample mean, but will not remove
systematic error.

<p>As seen from the paragraph above, accuracy is a very desirable measure,
since it is more general.  However, it is
generally quite difficult to obtain.  It requires strict control over 
sources of systematic error.

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h4><a name="link3"><hr>
<p>The Experimental Setup</a></h4>

<p> NMEA 0183 v.2.3 data are collected through the data port of a Garmin
GPSMAP 76
handheld receiver at 4800 baud.  Firmware version 2.03.  The connection is
through a combo PC serial and power cable sold by Garmin (010-10165-00).  
The power part of the cable
has a cigarette lighter adapter, which is plugged into a power supply
from Radio Shack.  

<p> The Garmin GPSMAP 76 is set to generate NMEA output in the
WGS 84 (G873) reference system, in UTC time.  These NMEA data contain 
unaugmented, single point position results.  24 hour data files are
collected starting at the beginning of each day at around 0000 UTC. 
The GPSMAP 76 is switched off and then on again at the beginning of each UTC day.

<p> A Mighty Mouse II external (active) antenna feeds to the Garmin GPSMAP 76
through the BNC connector.
The antenna is mounted in the attic of a townhouse.  While there is no direct view of
the sky, the antenna does pick up GPS satellites quite well.
(Up to 11 satellites in view)
  There is
some shielding of the sky view by two lateral connecting walls between the townhouses.
The antenna location is convenient for GPS monitoring, but is susceptible to
multipath.  The antenna setup remained undisturbed throughout the data
collection period.  Note that since the antenna is stationary, the performance
statistics represent a stationary mode.  GPS receivers may display 
different performances when mobile, due to internal Kalman filters or 
dynamic tracking loops.

<p> NMEA data are generated by the Garmin GPSMAP 76 at a nominal 2 second rate
(not adjustable).  The NMEA ASCII data are collected with a home-brewed Java 2 
application "<a href="GarNMEA.java.txt">GarNMEA</a>" running on a PC-type laptop 
(Pentium II, 266 MHz).

<p> After each collection of (about) 24 hours of NMEA data, they are processed
through a sequence of steps.  First, the data are decimated to 30 seconds and
the "$GPGGA" sentences are parsed to extract geodetic latitude, longitude,
orthometric and geoid heights.  Orthometric and geoid heights are summed to
generate the ellipsoidal heights.  The time of day in seconds, geodetic latitudes,
longitudes, and ellipsoid heights are written to a file for subsequent
processing.

<p> Next, the decimated data are processed for the precision results.  The average
geodetic latitude, longitude, and ellipsoid height is computed for each daily
file.  Horizontal and vertical residuals (departures) between each data point
and the daily mean are formed.  The horizontal and absolute value of the vertical 
residuals are 
sorted, and the 95% limit is reported.  

<p> A similar process is used for the accuracy results.  The "true" position
of the antenna was established by 
<a href="#link4">the method described below</a>.
Horizontal and vertical residuals (departures) between each data point
and the true values are formed.  The horizontal and absolute value of the vertical 
residuals are 
sorted, and the 95% limit is reported.

<p> It should be noted that the method of establishing the 95% limit
for precision and accuracy is nonparametric in character.  That is,
there is no underlying assumptions on distribution of the residuals.
The residuals are sorted in ascending order, counted, and the 95% error
limit is reported.  The errors will contain non-Gaussian, time correlated
error sources, such as unmodeled atmospheric effects and multipath.  
It wasn't felt that derivation of 95% critical values from sample
standard deviations (assuming underlying Gaussian or Rayleigh statistics) 
would be desirable.


<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h4><a name="link4"><hr>
<p>Establishing the "True" Coordinates</a></h4>

<p>To detect systematic error, one needs reference coordinates; 
preferably, as error free as possible.  A typical source of such
control is a monumented point surveyed by a geodetic agency or a
state highway department.

<p>In this case, the reference location was the phase center of the
Mighty Mouse II antenna, mounted on an unused TV antenna in the
attic of a townhouse.  The general methodology was to process
carrier phase data extracted from the Garmin proprietary (binary)
data streams taken prior to the May experiment.  Phase data were processed in
both double difference and in triple difference modes.  As a cross-check,
carrier phase data were processed from a CMC (now BAE) Superstar development 
kit using a separate GPS active antenna mounted on that same TV antenna.

<p>The extraction of carrier phase was performed with a Garmin 12XL,
and is described
 in the web pages of Professor Antonio Tabernero Galán,

<a href="http://artico.lma.fi.upm.es/numerico/miembros/antonio/async/">"Obtaining raw data from some Garmin units"</a>.

His "async" application logs the Garmin binary data.
Initially, his "gar2rnx" program was used to translate the binary
data into a Rinex format.  But, later, a home-brewed Fortran application, "g2r",
performed this function (written as I learned more about the binary format).

<p>Rinex data from the Mighty Mouse II antenna location were combined with
Rinex data from the 
<a href="http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/CORS/">National CORS</a>
station, GAIT; which is just under
7 km away.  These are single frequency (L1) results.  But it expected
that the differential ionosphere error should seldom exceed 5 PPM
(3.5 cm).  Processing was performed with JPL orbits in the ITRF97(1997.0) reference
system.  The reference coordinate for the GAIT L1 phase center was also in the ITRF97(1997.0) frame.
The final coordinates are in the ITRF97(1997.0) frame, not in the WGS 84 (G873).
However, this small difference (~10 cm) should be considered negligible for the
purposes of this experiment.

<p>The translated Garmin 12XL data have a large number of cycle
slips, and these are half-wavelength cycle slips.  That is, a cycle slip
can be 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, ... L1 wavelengths.  Triple difference processing,
when combined with outlier detection, is highly robust against cycle slips.
Long data spans (such as 24 hours) help improve the less accurate results
typically associated with triple differences.

<p>Double difference processing requires the detection and repair of the
half-integer cycle slips.  The experimental software was only successful
in certain segments of the data stream.  Even so, a couple of sets of 
around 2 hours duration were repaired and solved.  It must be emphasized that 
any processing software that is applied must be able to accommodate
half-integer cycle slips/ambiguities.

<p>The three 24 hour triple difference solutions agreed with 4 cm.
The double difference and triple difference results compared at
a 14 cm level.  This Mighty Mouse II ellipsoid height also matched
the BAE Superstar results within this tolerance.  This agreement of
results, while single frequency, in the ITRF97(1997.0) frame, with no differential
troposphere correction, is encouraging.

<p>It is believed that the reference coordinates for the Mighty 
Mouse II antenna are probably accurate to better than 0.5 meters.

<p>Some Error and DOP Plots</a></h4>

This section is dedicated to John Bonde,
based on his excellent
questions.  The plots are for June 8, 2001.  

<ul>
  <li><a href="ehor0608.gif"  >Horizontal Error</a></li>
  <li><a href="ehor06082.gif" >Horizontal Error (N/S vs. E/W)</a></li>
  <li><a href="hdop0608.gif"  >HDOP</a></li>
  <li><a href="herdop0608.gif">Horizontal Error vs. HDOP</a></li>
  <li><a href="ever0608.gif"  >Vertical Error</a></li>
  <li><a href="vdop0608.gif"  >VDOP</a></li>
  <li><a href="verdop0608.gif">Vertical Error vs. VDOP</a></li>
  <li><a href="herver0608.gif">Horizontal Error vs. Vertical Error</a></li>
</ul>

<p>It is seen that the HDOP's look very much like those for the
<a href="hdop0504.gif">Garmin 12XL</a>. 
This should be no surprise, since the same antenna was used,
and there is not much blockage to cause differences
in the satellite visibility between May and June. 
The HDOP's reach a low of 0.8 and seldom exceed 2.0.

<p>The horizontal error is plotted in two ways.  One is as a time
series, and the other is as an overhead view of scatter.
Because of the finer granularity of the GPSMAP 76
NMEA messages compared to those of the 12XL (factor of 10),
structure in the horizontal error is seen to be roughly 
comparable to that in the vertical error.

<p>The vertical error is not centered about 0.  As was seen in the 
<a href="ever0504.gif">12XL vertical error</a>,
there is an upward systematic error.  Unlike the 12XL, this 
systematic error is of much smaller magnitude.  This is believed
to be due to incorporation of the broadcast ionosphere model
(and possibly a simple troposphere model).  However such models
are simple, and residual error can cause the systematic shift.

<p>To gain a better perspective of the relation between error
and satellite geometries (DOP), plots are presented showing 
Horizontal Error vs. HDOP and Vertical Error vs. VDOP.
It is seen that there is no marked correlation between
the error and the DOP's.  Many cases are evident of low DOP's
and high errors, and vice versa.  

<p>As noted with the 12XL, the horizontal and vertical errors
do not <em>look</em> random.  Aside from the spikes, one can see
gradual drifts, and more rapid oscillations within those drifts.
This is the time correlation (caused by various systematic errors)
noted by other investigators.  To reliably average a point, a good
deal of data is needed.

<p>As further investigation, the horizontal and vertical departures 
from the mean plotted against each other.  The vertical departures
("residuals") have the absolute value taken; so that they are 
comparable to the horizontal ("radial") departures.  Here a distinct,
although noisy, trend is seen.  Horizontal error is correlated with
vertical error.  The ratio of horizontal to vertical error is seen
to range from about 1:1 to 1:4.  It is gratifying to note that these
ratios are not inconsistent with what one would expect from DOP's.

<p>The conclusions that can be drawn from these plots is that there is
systematic error that has a time variable character, but is not strongly
linked to satellite geometry.
Note that this may only hold for the low (good)
DOP levels that were obtained.  The correlation between horizontal and
vertical error is consistent with error due to residual 
ionosphere or multipath effects.

<p>Next are PDF reports describing GPS (and WAAS) performance.  Their GPS PAN archive index is incomplete,
but the reports are present in the "reports" directory.  For example: GPS PAN report #47 can be found at:
http://www.nstb.tc.faa.gov/reports/pan47_1004.pdf   For the GPS PAN reports, pay particular attention to 
Figures 5-1 and 5-2.  Also, monitor site behavior is broken out in Table 5-1.  Note that the "Predictable
Accuracy" values quoted in their Appendix A's are based on the <em>worst</em> monitor site in the quarter.

<p>My e-mail user name is the first initial of my first name
followed by all the letters of my last name (see above).  My ISP is
"comcast", and it is a "dot-net", not a "dot-com".  Sorry for not spelling
out my e-mail address, but I try to keep the spam-bots
from fingering me.  But, just so the spam-bots don't feel left
out, they can always go to abuse@comcast.net
