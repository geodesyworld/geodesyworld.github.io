<p>The results above are derived from Garmin GPSMAP 76 NMEA sentences.
The horizontal coordinates are expressed to the nearest
0.0001 arc minute in latitude/longitude.  This works out to about
18 centimeters (N/S) and 14 centimeters (E/W).  Height is expressed to
the nearest 0.1 meter.  Note that the horizontal "least count" is
10 times finer than that of the Garmin 12XL.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h4><a name="link2"><hr>
<p>Precision vs. Accuracy</a></h4>

<p>Precision is not the same as accuracy.  Accuracy is a measure of departure
from the true value of a quantity.  Precision, on the other hand, is a 
measure of the "repeatability" of the data.  The difference between accuracy
and precision is known as "bias" or "systematic error".  Taking large amounts
of data will improve the precision of a sample mean, but will not remove
systematic error.

<p>As seen from the paragraph above, accuracy is a very desirable measure,
since it is more general.  However, it is
generally quite difficult to obtain.  It requires strict control over 
sources of systematic error.

<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h4><a name="link3"><hr>
<p>The Experimental Setup</a></h4>

<p>NMEA 0183 v.2.3 data are collected through the data port of a Garmin
GPSMAP 76 handheld receiver at 4800 baud. Firmware version 2.03. The connection
is through a combo PC serial and power cable sold by Garmin (010-10165-00).
The power part of the cable has a cigarette lighter adapter, which is plugged
into a power supply from Radio Shack.

<p>The Garmin GPSMAP 76 is set to generate NMEA output in the WGS 84 (G873)
reference system, in UTC time. These NMEA data contain WAAS-corrected,
single point position results. 24 hour data files are collected starting
at the beginning of each day at around 0000 UTC. The GPSMAP 76 is switched
off and then on again at the beginning of each UTC day.  Logging is started
when all visible satellites are showing WAAS augmentation.

<p>As a minor note, although the Garmin GPSMAP 76 was set to generate NMEA
output in the WGS 84 (G873) reference system, it is likely that the process
of using WAAS correctors actually transformed the output into the ITRF94(1996.0)
reference frame. However, since these two frames coincide at a few cm level,
the discrepency is negligible. It is conceivable that the GPSMAP 76 could
be applying a small correction (ITRF94 --> WGS84), but, IMHO, this is unlikely.

<p>A Mighty Mouse II external (active) antenna feeds to the Garmin GPSMAP
76 through the BNC connector. The antenna is mounted in the attic of a
townhouse. While there is no direct view of the sky, the antenna does pick
up GPS satellites quite well. (Up to 11 satellites in view) There is some
shielding of the sky view by two lateral connecting walls between the townhouses.
The antenna location is convenient for GPS monitoring, but is susceptible
to multipath. The antenna setup remained undisturbed throughout the data
collection period. Note that since the antenna is stationary, the performance
statistics represent a stationary mode. GPS receivers may display different
performances when mobile, due to internal Kalman filters or dynamic tracking
loops.

<p>NMEA data are generated by the Garmin GPSMAP 76 at a nominal 2 second
rate (not adjustable). The NMEA ASCII data are collected with a home-brewed
Java 2 application "<a href="GarNMEA.java.txt">GarNMEA</a>" running on
a PC-type laptop (Pentium II, 266 MHz).

<p>After each collection of (about) 24 hours of NMEA data, they are processed
through a sequence of steps. First, the data are decimated to 30 seconds
and the "$GPGGA" sentences are parsed to extract geodetic latitude, longitude,
orthometric and geoid heights. Orthometric and geoid heights are summed
to generate the ellipsoidal heights. The time of day in seconds, geodetic
latitudes, longitudes, and ellipsoid heights are written to a file for
subsequent processing.

<p>Next, the decimated data are processed for the precision results. The
average geodetic latitude, longitude, and ellipsoid height is computed
for each daily file. Horizontal and vertical residuals (departures) between
each data point and the daily mean are formed. The horizontal and absolute
value of the vertical residuals are sorted, and the 95% limit is reported.

<p>A similar process is used for the accuracy results. The "true" position
of the antenna was established by <a href="#link4">the method described
below</a>. Horizontal and vertical residuals (departures) between each
data point and the true values are formed. The horizontal and absolute
value of the vertical residuals are sorted, and the 95% limit is reported.

<p>It should be noted that the method of establishing the 95% limit for
precision and accuracy is nonparametric in character. That is, there is
no underlying assumptions on distribution of the residuals. The residuals
are sorted in ascending order, counted, and the 95% error limit is reported.
The errors will contain non-Gaussian, time correlated error sources, such
as unmodeled atmospheric effects and multipath. It wasn't felt that derivation
of 95% critical values from sample standard deviations (assuming underlying
Gaussian or Rayleigh statistics) would be desirable.


<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h4><a name="link4"><hr>
<p>Establishing the "True" Coordinates</a></h4>

<p>To detect systematic error, one needs reference coordinates; 
preferably, as error free as possible.  A typical source of such
control is a monumented point surveyed by a geodetic agency or a
state highway department.

<p>In this case, the reference location was the phase center of the
Mighty Mouse II antenna, mounted on an unused TV antenna in the
attic of a townhouse.  The general methodology was to process
carrier phase data extracted from the Garmin proprietary (binary)
data streams taken prior to the May experiment.  Phase data were processed in
both double difference and in triple difference modes.  As a cross-check,
carrier phase data were processed from a CMC (now BAE) Superstar development 
kit using a separate GPS active antenna mounted on that same TV antenna.

<p>The extraction of carrier phase was performed with a Garmin 12XL,
and is described
 in the web pages of Professor Antonio Tabernero Galán,

<a href="http://artico.lma.fi.upm.es/numerico/miembros/antonio/async/">"Obtaining raw data from some Garmin units"</a>.

His "async" application logs the Garmin binary data.
Initially, his "gar2rnx" program was used to translate the binary
data into a Rinex format.  But, later, a home-brewed Fortran application, "g2r",
performed this function (written as I learned more about the binary format).

<p>Rinex data from the Mighty Mouse II antenna location were combined with
Rinex data from the 
<a href="http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/CORS/">National CORS</a>
station, GAIT; which is just under
7 km away.  These are single frequency (L1) results.  But it expected
that the differential ionosphere error should seldom exceed 5 PPM
(3.5 cm).  Processing was performed with JPL orbits in the ITRF97(1997.0) reference
system.  The reference coordinate for the GAIT L1 phase center was also in the ITRF97(1997.0) frame.
The final coordinates are in the ITRF97(1997.0) frame, not in the WGS 84 (G873).
However, this small difference (~10 cm) should be considered negligible for the
purposes of this experiment.

<p>The translated Garmin 12XL data have a large number of cycle
slips, and these are half-wavelength cycle slips.  That is, a cycle slip
can be 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, ... L1 wavelengths.  Triple difference processing,
when combined with outlier detection, is highly robust against cycle slips.
Long data spans (such as 24 hours) help improve the less accurate results
typically associated with triple differences.

<p>Double difference processing requires the detection and repair of the
half-integer cycle slips.  The experimental software was only successful
in certain segments of the data stream.  Even so, a couple of sets of 
around 2 hours duration were repaired and solved.  It must be emphasized that 
any processing software that is applied must be able to accommodate
half-integer cycle slips/ambiguities.

<p>The three 24 hour triple difference solutions agreed with 4 cm.
The double difference and triple difference results compared at
a 14 cm level.  This Mighty Mouse II ellipsoid height also matched
the BAE Superstar results within this tolerance.  This agreement of
results, while single frequency, in the ITRF97(1997.0) frame, with no differential
troposphere correction, is encouraging.

<p>It is believed that the reference coordinates for the Mighty 
Mouse II antenna are probably accurate to better than 0.5 meters.

<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2"><h4><a name="link5"><hr>
<p>Talk about WAAS</a></h4>

<p>WAAS stands for Wide Area Augmentation System. It is sometimes thought
of as a "Coast Guard-like" system that uses geostationary satellites, instead
of ground-based beacons, to provide improved GPS accuracy. The details
of operation, however, show it to be a different kind of creature. But,
the result is the same: higher accuracy (and integrity).

<p>The WAAS signal is on the L1 frequency (1575.42 MHz). It is beamed from
geostationary satellites (GEOs), instead of from the GPS satellites themselves.
The WAAS signal shares the L1 frequency with GPS. This apparent conflict
is resolved by assigning different PRN codes to the WAAS (120-138). This
allows a GPS receiver (with suitable firmware) to acquire WAAS signals
as well as the GPS. By contrast, Coast Guard beacons transmit on several
frequencies around 300 KHz, and require a separate receiver/antenna.

<p>The WAAS signal has different content than that of the Coast Guard.
The WAAS messages provide corrections to the GPS broadcast orbits and clocks,
whereas the Coast Guard messages are corrections to pseudoranges. The WAAS
messages can be thought of as providing an improved orbit/clock model,
while the Coast Guard messages indicate the misfit between the GPS broadcast
orbit/clock and the "truth". The WAAS messages have specific elements for
orbit and clock, and are computed for the various satellites (PRN's). The
WAAS also transmits ionospheric corrections in a grid format. The Coast
Guard messages are an aggregate element that includes orbit, clock, ionosphere,
troposphere, etc..., as sensed at a specific beacon.

<p>So, what does this mean?

<p>The WAAS signals are general. This is where the "WA" in "WAAS" comes
from -- "Wide Area". The Coast Guard signals are specific to a beacon location.
That is, DGPS is very good when very close to a beacon, and degrades further
away. One DGPS rule of thumb is 1 meter + 1 meter/100 km of distance. The
WAAS accuracy is more uniform within the service area.

<p>This also means that the WAAS has a different support infrastructure
than that of the Coast Guard. To compute these more general correction
messages, data are shipped to master stations (WAMS -- Wide Area Master
Stations), for processing and subsequent uplink thru 3 different Ground
Earth Stations. The current system has 25 reference stations and 2 master
stations. By contrast, the Coast Guard messages are computed and transmitted
locally at each beacon site.

<p>The WAAS was designed specifically as a system for aviation navigation
(from en route to precision approach). As such, transmitting the WAAS messages
from GEOs was seen as appropriate, since an aircraft at altitude would
generally see a GEO. On the ground, when the line of sight to a GEO is
blocked, you don't get WAAS. WAAS is currently served by two GEOs (Inmarsat
III):

<pre> 
Name     Series      Long.    PRN    Garmin ID
-----    -------    ------    ---    ---------
AOR-W    3F4          54W     122       35
POR      3F3/2F1     178E     134       47
</pre>

<p>For a picture of the GEO footprints, as well as other WAAS info, go to
<a href="http://www.gpsinformation.net/exe/waas.html">Jack Yeazel's page</a>.

<p>The WAAS system also provides corrections in a different datum than
that of the Coast Guard DGPS. WAAS uses reference coordinates in ITRF94(1996.0),
which can be considered equivalent to WGS 84 (G873). The Coast Guard system
uses NAD 83 reference coordinates. Hence, application of the correctors,
either to broadcast elements (WAAS) or to pseudoranges (DGPS) yield different
datums. As always, coordinates computed in a GPS receiver can always be
transformed into another datum for output.

<p>An interesting aspect of the WAAS system is that it is possible to use
the L1 WAAS signal from the GEOs as a ranging signal, much as is done with
the L1 signals from GPS. In WAAS, the GEOs are used as an "extra GPS satellite".
The WAAS broadcast messages include orbit and apparent clock info for the
GEOs. This is why in a GPSMAP 76 it is possible to see both a grey bar
as well as a solid black bar appear for the WAAS GEO. The solid black bar
indicates that the GEO satellite's navigation information has been received,
its ranging signal is being received, and that it is directly participating
in the position solution.

<p>The generation of the WAAS ranging signal itself is also interesting.
In GPS, the range signal is generated from a set of atomic clocks onboard
the GPS satellite. In WAAS, the signal is generated <i>on the ground</i>
with WAAS Network Time. The signal is beamed up to the GEO, where a "bent
pipe" transponder sends it back down to the service area.

<p>One aspect of both DGPS and WAAS, not tested here, is that they both provide
an integrity signal (timely warnings when user position errors grow too
large for a given application).

<p>Just a final word. Official description of the WAAS program is found
at the <a href="http://gps.faa.gov/Programs/index.htm">FAA Programs Page</a>
and clicking on the left menu for the WAAS Program.
The WAAS Specification is documented in
<a href="http://www.faa.gov/asd/international/GUIDANCE_MATL/2892b_c1.pdf">"2892b_c1.pdf"</a>.

<p>Some Error and DOP Plots</a></h4>

This section is dedicated to John Bonde, based on his excellent
questions.  The plots are for July 9, 2001.  

<ul>
  <li><a href="ehor0709.gif"  >Horizontal Error</a></li>
  <li><a href="ehor07092.gif" >Horizontal Error (N/S vs. E/W)</a></li>
  <li><a href="hdop0709.gif"  >HDOP</a></li>
  <li><a href="nsat0709.gif"  >Number of Satellites</a></li>
  <li><a href="herdop0709.gif">Horizontal Error vs. HDOP</a></li>
  <li><a href="ever0709.gif"  >Vertical Error</a></li>
  <li><a href="vdop0709.gif"  >VDOP</a></li>
  <li><a href="verdop0709.gif">Vertical Error vs. VDOP</a></li>
  <li><a href="herver0709.gif">Horizontal Error vs. Vertical Error</a></li>
</ul>

<p>It is seen that the HDOP's look very much like those for the
<a href="hdop0504.gif">Garmin 12XL</a> and the 
<a href="hdop0608.gif">non-WAAS 76</a>. 
This should be no surprise, since the same antenna was used,
and there is not much blockage to cause differences
in the satellite visibility between May and July. 
The HDOP's reach a low of 0.8 and seldom exceed 2.0.

<p>The horizontal error is plotted in two ways.  One is as a time
series, and the other is as an overhead view of scatter.
Because of the finer granularity of the GPSMAP 76
NMEA messages compared to those of the 12XL (factor of 10),
structure in the horizontal error is seen to be roughly 
comparable to that in the vertical error.

<p>The vertical error is not centered about 0.  As was seen in the 
<a href="ever0504.gif">12XL vertical error</a> and the 
<a href="ever0608.gif">non-WAAS 76 vertical error</a>,
there is an upward systematic error.  Unlike the 12XL, this 
systematic error is of much smaller magnitude.
And when compared to the GPSMAP 76 with WAAS off, there is 
little discernable systematic error.
The WAAS corrections incorporate a gridded ionosphere model
that is updated on a frequent basis.  This is seen to be
superior to the GPS broadcast ionosphere model.
Both the WAAS corrected and non-WAAS corrected results will
share the same troposphere model error.

<p>To gain a better perspective of the relation between error
and satellite geometries (DOP), plots are presented showing 
Horizontal Error vs. HDOP and Vertical Error vs. VDOP.
It is seen that there is no marked correlation between
the error and the DOP's.  Many cases are evident of low DOP's
and high errors, and vice versa.  

<p>As noted with the 12XL, the horizontal and vertical errors
do not <em>look</em> random.  Aside from the spikes, one can see
gradual drifts, and more rapid oscillations within those drifts.
This is the time correlation (caused by various systematic errors)
noted by other investigators.  To reliably average a point, a good
deal of data is needed.

<p>As further investigation, the horizontal and vertical departures 
from the mean plotted against each other.  The vertical departures
("residuals") have the absolute value taken; so that they are 
comparable to the horizontal ("radial") departures.  Here a distinct,
although noisy, trend is seen.  Horizontal error is correlated with
vertical error.  The ratio of horizontal to vertical error is seen
to range from about 1:1 to 1:4.  It is gratifying to note that these
ratios are not inconsistent with what one would expect from DOP's.

<p>The conclusions that can be drawn from these plots is that there is
systematic error that has a time variable character, but is not strongly
linked to satellite geometry.
Note that this may only hold for the low (good)
DOP levels that were obtained.  The correlation between horizontal and
vertical error is consistent with error due to residual 
ionosphere or multipath effects.

<p>The results above are derived from Garmin GPSMAP 76 NMEA sentences.
The horizontal coordinates are expressed to the nearest
0.0001 arc minute in latitude/longitude.  This works out to about
18 centimeters (N/S) and 14 centimeters (E/W).  Height is expressed to
the nearest 0.1 meter.  Note that the horizontal "least count" is
10 times finer than that of the Garmin 12XL.

<p>Next are PDF reports describing GPS (and WAAS) performance.  Their GPS PAN archive index is incomplete,
but the reports are present in the "reports" directory.  For example: GPS PAN report #47 can be found at:
http://www.nstb.tc.faa.gov/reports/pan47_1004.pdf   For the GPS PAN reports, pay particular attention to 
Figures 5-1 and 5-2.  Also, monitor site behavior is broken out in Table 5-1.  Note that the "Predictable
Accuracy" values quoted in their Appendix A's are based on the <em>worst</em> monitor site in the quarter.
